            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>NOw in our extreame Distractions, when forraign forces threaten, and propably are invited, and a malignant and Popish party at home offended? The Devil hath cast a hone, and raised a contestation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament touching the</hi> Militia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Maiesty claims the disposing of at to be in Him by right of Law; The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament saith</hi> rebus sic stantibus, <hi>and</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti Rege, <hi>the Ordering of it is in them?</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:61356:3"/>
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>VVHich Question, may receive its solution by this distinction. That there is in Laws an equitable, and a litterall sence. His Majesty (let it be granted) is intrusted by Law with the <hi>Militia,</hi> but it's for the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervation of the Republique, against Forraign Invasions, or Domestique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.</p>
               <p>For it cannot be supposed, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would ever by Law intrust the King with the <hi>Militia</hi> against themselves, or the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that intrusts them to provide for their Weal, not for their woe.</p>
               <p>So that when there is certain appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance grounded suspition, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law shall be improved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:61356:3"/>the <hi>Equity</hi> of it (that is, the publique good, whether of the body reall or representative) then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander going against its <hi>Equity,</hi> gives Liberty to the Commanded to refuse <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Letter: for the Law taken abstract from its originall reason and end, is made a shell without a ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, a shadow without a substance, and a body without a soul. It is the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws according to their <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reason,</hi> which (as I may say) is the spirit that gives life to Authority, the Letter kills.</p>
               <p>Nor need this <hi>Equity</hi> be expressed in the Law, being so Naturally implyed and supposed in all Laws that are not meerly Imperiall, from that Analogy, which all bodies politique hold with the Naturall; whence all Government and Governors borrow a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Respect; And therfore when the <hi>Militia</hi> of an Army is committed to the General, it is not with any expresse
<pb facs="tcp:61356:4"/>condition, that he shall not turn the mouths of his <hi>Canons</hi> against his Own Souldiers; for that is so Naturally and necessarily implyed, that its needlesse to be expressed, insomuch as if he did attempt or command such a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the nature of his trust and place, it did <hi>ipso facto</hi> estate the Army, in a right of disobedience, except we think that obedience binds Men to, cut their own throats, or their companions.</p>
               <p>And indeed if this destinction be not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the Legall and mixt <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the greatest <hi>Tiranny,</hi> for if Laws invest the King in an absolute power, and the letter be not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the equity, then whereas other Kings that are absolute <hi>Monarcks</hi> and rule by will and not by Law, are Tyrants perforce. Those that rule by Law and not by will, have hereby a <hi>Tirany</hi> confer'd upon them legally, and so the very end of Laws, which is to give bounds and limits to the exorbitant wills of Princes, is by the Laws disapointed, for they hereby give corrobaration (and much more Iustification to an arbitrary <hi>Tyranny,</hi> by making it legall, not assumed; which Laws are ordained to crasse not countenance:
<pb facs="tcp:61356:4"/>and therefore is the latter (where it seems abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute) alwayes to receive quallification from the Equity, else the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said absurdity must follow.</p>
